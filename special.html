<h1>Special Characters</h1>
<p>Since &lt, &gt, &amp have special meaning HTML, you can't use these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called <q>special characters</q> to represent them. For example, to have a less than sign appear in your document, you need to use <code>&amplt</code>; to represent it.</p>
