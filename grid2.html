<h2>CSS grid layout (from Wikipedia article)</h2>
<p>
<b>CSS grid layout</b> or <b>CSS grid</b> is a technique in Cascading Style
Sheets that allows web developers to create complex responsive web design
layouts more easily and consistently across browsers. There have been other
webpage layout methods used previously including tables, the box model, and CSS
flex box. It is currently a W3C Candidate Recommendation despite already being
adopted by most major browsers.
</p>
<p>
CSS grid can create more asymmetrical layouts than the previous grid and layout
options like CSS floats. It also allows for more standardized code that works
across browsers. This is in contrast to relying on specific browser hacks or
complicated workarounds.
</p>
<p>
One issue with using floats in CSS is if content gets added to one portion of
the page it could disrupt the flow of the page and break the layout. This is
due to the varying heights for layout elements. Though CSS flex box supports
flexible layouts and provides the flexibility of creating complex layouts, it
fails when the need for creating responsive layouts in 2-dimensional space
arises. That is where CSS grid layout shines.
